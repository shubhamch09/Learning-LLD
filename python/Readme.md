# Python LLD Concepts

This directory contains my learnings and implementations of Low Level Design (LLD) concepts using Python. Each design pattern, concept, or task is separated into its own subfolder, with source code, explanations, and example usage.

## Structure

- Each concept is organized in its own folder (e.g., `singleton/`, `factory/`, `observer/`).
- Folders typically include:
  - Python source files (`.py`)
  - Documentation/explanation
  - Example scripts
  - (Optional) Unit tests

## How to Use

1. Explore the folders to find different LLD concepts and their Python implementations.
2. Read the documentation or explanation inside each folder for details and usage.
3. Run example scripts using Python 3 from your terminal or IDE.

## Technologies

- Python 3.7 or above (unless noted otherwise)
- pytest or unittest (for testing, where included)
