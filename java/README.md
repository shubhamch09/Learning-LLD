# Java LLD Concepts

This directory contains my learnings and implementations of Low Level Design (LLD) concepts using Java. Each LLD concept or design pattern is organized into its own subfolder, with source code, documentation, and test cases where applicable.

## Structure

- Each concept has its own folder (e.g., `singleton/`, `factory/`, `observer/`).
- Every folder includes:
  - Source code (`.java` files)
  - Explanation/documentation
  - Example usage
  - (Optional) Unit tests

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders to view different LLD concepts and their Java implementations.
2. Refer to the documentation inside each folder for details and usage instructions.
3. Run example code using your preferred Java IDE or via the command line.

## Technologies

- Java 8 or above (unless specified otherwise)
- JUnit (for testing, where applicable)
